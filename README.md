# Time-Series-Characteristics
Various time series charateristics collected from related work, sorted and grouped according to their properties.

Time series charateristics are features calculated from time series. They represents various properties, such as trends, frequency information, correlation, etc.

## Code for Time Series Characteristics
The code for the time series characteristics is contained in the single file `time_series_characteristics.py`.

## Detailed group information + testing
The jupyter notebook `feature_groups.ipynb` provides more details on the time series characteristic groups and subgroups, including information on why we decided to drop some features, information on normalization, from where the features originate, etc.

To quickly gain some insights, an evaluted notebook is provided as an HTML file `feature_groups.html`.
